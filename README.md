- 👋 Hi, I’m @python-rpa-dev
- 👀 I’m interested in tinkering with Python and RPA (Robot Automation Process)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python eco system and automating stuff on the GUI layer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python but also Databases like Oracle & APEX  
- 📫 How to reach me is by sending me an email, replacing the - with . and use @google.com. 
    - Yup, it's a bit of a riddle but I try to keep the mail scrapper away 😉
